# STM32MP157-Smart-Home
A Smart Home with Remote Control Features Based on the STM32MP157 Development Board
  In today's society, air quality has become a focal point of public concern. With the acceleration of urbanization, the emissions of exhaust gases from industry and transportation are becoming increasingly severe, leading to more serious air pollution. The demand for fresh air is growing day by day, and traditional air purification equipment is difficult to meet the needs of high efficiency and energy saving. Therefore, we are committed to developing an intelligent air purification system that integrates advanced sensor technology and intelligent control systems to effectively monitor and purify indoor air, providing a fresh and healthy living environment. This system, based on the STM32 chip, not only provides power for the device but also intelligently controls lighting, air purifiers, and humidifiers to maintain a high-quality indoor environment. At the same time, the system supports remote monitoring and control, improving energy utilization efficiency and creating a more comfortable and convenient living experience for users.
